BTS Dynamite

[Intro: Jungkook]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight

[Verse 1: Jungkook]
Shoes on, get up in the morn'
Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
King Kong, kick the drum
Rolling on like a Rolling Stone
Sing song when I'm walking home
Jump up to the top, LeBron
Ding-dong, call me on my phone
Ice tea and a game of ping pong

[Pre-Chorus: RM, j-hope]
This is getting heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Hey, so let's go

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh


[Verse 2: V, RM]
Bring a friend, join the crowd, whoever wanna come along
Word up, talk the talk, just move like we off the wall
Day or night, the sky's alight, so we dance to the break of dawn (Hey)
Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine so you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Suga, Jimin, RM]
This is getting heavy, can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (Woo-hoo)
Life is sweet as honey, yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
I'm diamond, you know I glow up
Let's go

[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
'Cause I, I, I'm in the stars tonight
So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (Hey)
Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
So I'ma light it up like dynamite, woah-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin, Jin]

Drippin', water faucet, splash (Splash)


[Chorus]
VVS my diamonds, I don't need no light to shine
Iced out both my wrists, now I can barely see the time
I just made a million and I'm still not satisfied
'Cause I need a bag on the regular
I spend a bag on the regular

Hopped out the coupe, the sky is the roof (Roof)
My whole team ball (Ball)
We never lose, hundreds all blue (Hundreds)
We do what we do (Ball)

[Verse 7: Haechan & WinWin]
Hoppin' out casket-fresh, looking like a fashion show (Ayy)
Diamonds all on my neck, looking like a water show (Ayy, let's go)

[Verse 8: Mark]
We gon' bring out the car
One way, no stop, to the stars (Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah)

One way to Mars, you better watch yourself
I did it all by myself (Go!)

[Pre-Chorus: Taeil, Taeyong, Jaehyun, Jungwoo, Taeyong & Johnny]
And now we in a zone (Ice, ice)
Stand too close, might catch a cold (Stand too close)
